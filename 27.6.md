# Changelog
- Added apoc.text.join to create string in place of reduce
- read expandconfig in-depth to see if i can get it to work with 3+ nodes in path
    - not possible
- started looking into cypher dsl for crafting 3+node paths
# Misc. Notes
Shortest path only works for relationship between 2 nodes
```
shortestPath(...) requires a pattern containing a single relationship (line 1, column 9 (offset: 8))
"match p=shortestPath((n:Movie)-[*]-(m:Movie)-[*]-(k:Movie))"
```
[apoc.path.expandConfig](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/overview/apoc.path/apoc.path.expandConfig/) also only works between 2 nodes, where we can specify terminating node by label or by match. This means that we cannot define a waypoint that has to be present on the path.

[apoc.path.expandConfig](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/overview/apoc.path/apoc.path.expandConfig/) was preferred to be able to specify path length range using arguments. We could also add label black/white list + repeating pattern of relationships with direction.
