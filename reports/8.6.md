# Changelog
- Read https://medium.com/neo4j/spring-into-neo4j-with-spring-data-5-spring-boot-2-and-neo4j-3962fb1ea067
	- outdated but seems to have provided a way of [[visualisation]] of paths with d3js
- Completed https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#mapping.annotations until query section
	- Looked into querying for paths am quite lost
		- Initially was referred to multi-level projections in forums but the documentation is extremely vague https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.sdn.multi-level
		- https://lankydan.dev/mapping-a-path-query-in-spring-data-neo4j seemed promising but is outdated - @QueryResult is deprecated in favour of projected results
			- Example and Class-based projections seem relevant
		- Eventually found a lead in https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#custom-queries with a section on paths. Need to pursue this, cypherdsl usage and class-based projections in the future
	- Generally very confusing to follow, no good quick-start guide provided
		- As mentioned at last meeting, the only complete quick-start provided was broken
- Roughly get the idea to make a basic query handler, will start tomorrow. I think after starting and compiling my basic knowledge I can start to process the more complicated items
- Read Ryan and Qing Yu's repo again focusing on how the application can be interacted with (via REST API calls) and how custom queries are processed
# Blocking questions
- How much should I focus on immutability
	- Qing Ru's PoC did not use immutable classes but the documentation is pushing for immutability for performance and safety issues
- What is pagination in the context of this project?
	- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html
- How should I actually be building my Domain objects?
	- confusion came from documentation not explicitly mentioning how to create new data entities to be stored, only how to store them and how to define the domain classes.
	- Qing Ru used Builder which I cannot find information on from the spring data with Neo documentation.
	- I suspect I either need to create a blank domain object using noargsconstructor and set the properties using setters as per Example 65, or directly using constructor or factory method as per Example 6 and 12

# Misc. Notes
- I noticed that Qing Ru's repository does not utilise a lot of the features that are front-loaded in the Spring data documentation such as immutable object support with Wither methods and overloaded constructors.
- I feel like my head is spinning following so many different threads of information that I am incredibly unfamiliar with like atomic variables, methodhandles, classloader and propertyaccessors, particularly since I do not have a frame of reference nor use-case related to such ideas. 
	- Want to skip the unnecessary items but because all of these ideas are mixed together with actually important unfamiliar ideas and are given upfront in my tutorial, I am unable to piece out what I need until I already understand the material.
	- Currently understand ~70% of what I am reading after cleaving some unnecessary information threads
- unique identifier @Id != neo4j's internal Id
	- @GeneratedValue maps the @Id property of java class to Neo4j's internal Id
		- must be type Long or long
	- point of @Id still unknown
- custom queries like @Query hidden in appendix of documentation
## Ideas
- We could use MongoRepository from JPA to access mongodb, and possibly pull data directly from mongo instead of using JSON as an intermediary
	- PoC simply aims to show unwinding of nested data, and JSON is a more apt data source in my opinion since ultimately we want to accept incoming streaming JSON data
	- based on the idea of incoming data streams it would be interesting to look at reactive programming to process live data streaming, though i assume there are existing methods in Java that do not require adopting such a paradigm

# TODO
- Compile Todos
- Work on basic CRUD without relationship-based queries
- Work on basic relationship-based queries that return single-column results
- Afterwards then return to query section of the guide
	- work on multi-column and collect-involving queries afterwards
