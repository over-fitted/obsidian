# Misc Notes
- On Reactive programming
	- Basically functional programming on push-based streams (rather than pull-based), use async observers at end of stream
	- Useful for adding async functionality + high coupling between functions
		- use functions and observers to declare what you want rather than how to do it
- MVC vs Controller Service Repository was confusing
	- found this useful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35641071/how-does-spring-mvc-relate-to-service-controller-and-data-access-layers-in-a-we 
# Blocking
- Should I use blocking or imperative style with spring boot and neo4j?
- Still do not understand how composite properties/maps work in neo4j. All docs lead me back to maps as they are used in cypher queries, but not in how they can be stored as properties.

# TODO
- sync up all my todos
- consider reading spring in action textbook sent by Qing Ru, possibly over the weekend
