# Misc. Notes
- Added my views on spring vs neo4j driver
- Personally dislike using spring da
- ta because of the accessories making it hard to track how things work

# Difficulties faced
- Because I will likely not use any of my knowledge to do with the default neo4j java drivers, I think subconsciously I felt quite bummed out and was unable to focus on reading the spring documentation. Ended up falling asleep while watching tutorials or reading docs about 4 times today :/
- Wasted a lot of time reading subpar documentation, particularly with OGM which prescribed reading through sample projects, and quick-start documentation for spring data which omitted a lot of detail which gave me my initial false impression about spring data and sent me down a JPA rabbit hole
# Blocking issues
Not really blocking but more of a possible time sink, but need to decide what documentation to read and in what order to learn spring data between the following
	1. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#preface
1. https://neo4j.github.io/neo4j-java-driver-spring-boot-starter/current/#manual-introduction
2. https://neo4j.com/developer/spring-data-neo4j/#create-domain
# TODO
- Learn spring data, possibly using sample project prescribed by tutorial as per #3 above
- Work on simple auto-commit version of PoC without nodes
- Work on auto-commit version with nodes
- Sync up daily report todos with main confluence Andrew Report todos
