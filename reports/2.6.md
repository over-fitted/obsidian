## Changelog
- Met with Kheng Yew
	- discussed the experience so far, my goals and concerns
	- received encouragement to consider pursuing distributed databases and big data handling in the future
	- Told to seek out Zechy if we embark on the NLP-related extension
		- appears his team previously looked briefly into graph databases for NLP purposes as well
- Cleaned up notes with Zettelkasten tagging and source labelling
- Finished reading https://neo4j.com/docs/java-manual/current/session-api/

## Misc. Notes
- GraphDatabaseFactory from the neo4j library is used to spin up embedded database
## Issues I faced (non-blocking) 
- Got wrapped up in reading distributed database material in the form of sessions and causal consistency as part of neo4j driver docs, since the driver provides granular control over these mechanisms.
	- later found that these are all taught in the distributed databases mod I may take in the future
## Blocking issues
- Figuring out Qing Ru's method for connecting to neo4j based on her repo
	- added as a todo, not really blocking since have not spent too much time on this yet
## Todo
- Look into Qing Ru's method of implementing queries with accessories
- Create PoC without node entity return type nor json
	- use custom hard-coded data and queries between java and neo4j after deciding which to start with
	- return just properties akin to SQL return
- look into adapting for JSON data in Cypher
- look into adapting for JSON data by pre-processing in Java
## Added future Todos
- Make the programme async
- visualisation on front-end given node data
