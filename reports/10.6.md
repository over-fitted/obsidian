# Changelog
- Troubleshooted issues with REST endpoint not working and database connection configuration issues
	- everything magically worked after a while without changing much, don't really know why
	- class-based rest endpoint now works
- Started reading Spring in action version 6 till page 76
	- in hindsight a lot of issues i had with spring data I could have solved by reading this first
	- on the other hand a lot of info seems skippable like session and form handling. I think I will read till after they cover spring data over the weekend
	- switched to 6th edition since 5th edition is outdated (e.g. junit4 vs jupiter) and has errata
- skimmed "realworld" sample webapp in springboot. Appears that controller package should be nested within the corresponding entity package. Finally understand the complexity behind cross-domain queries
- Added Regex both with custom query and with spring data repository query

# Difficulties
- Glasses broke so could barely see imparing work
