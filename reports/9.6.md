# Changelog
- Coded out domain classes for all nodes as per Ryan's specifications
	- Note that data present in the dataset and in my database at the moment contains additional properties not in the specification. Will rework in the future
	- Awards are missing in my database
	- see design decisions
- Coded out basic Application Service Controller Repository
- Added basic queries for users and movies
	- findAll()
	- findPlotByTitle(title)
- Started compiling todos and questions

# Design decisions
- have root node of comments_on be user, all other relationships rooted on movie
	- users will make a lot of comments independently, better to save the user node each time than to save the entire movie node each time
	- More intuitive to standardise all relationships as store on source node rather than mixing with storing some on sink nodes
- change non-autogenerated id names to entityId
	- underscore is a reserved character so camelCase
	- autogenerated ids are just "id"
# Difficulties
- Had difficulty finding documentation on configuring database connection. Ended up using Application.properties to set environment variables for this but it's pretty much magic and I have no idea how this works nor what else I can do with it
	- No good documentation on this
- Everything refused to work until I deleted some stuff and rewrote them the exact same way and hey presto it works
	- wasted like 4 hours on this and it is maddening
- Need to use @Properties(nameOfNodeProperty) to map a class property to a neo4j node property if the names are not the same
	- had to rely on outdated tutorial for this zzz
- Spring documentation on connecting services to repositories is non-existent
# Misc. notes
- Qing Ru's repository was very helpful in pointing out what annotations to look for and how to structure my code
	- I feel like all the tutorials I have seen assume knowledge of lombok and spring data
- Relationships are defined based on the "root node" which can be either the source or sink but not both
	- need to decide ahead of time to standardise

# Todo
- Create basic query repo for each entity
- Compile items to sync up with Ryan on
- Compile Todos
- Compile items to research to do with spring
