# Changelog
- Read following tutorials:
	- https://neo4j.com/developer/spring-data-neo4j/#create-domain
	- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#preface
- Looked through atlassian comments and discussed with Ryan
	- decide to settle user stories again in the future
- Settled primary id issue in tigergraph with Ryan
- read up on constraints and keys in neo4j
- set up spring boot environment for the tutorial
	- took a lot of time as per blockers.1 and 2


# Blockers
- spent a lot of time stuck learning about java modules to keep up with tutorial
	- ended up omitting the module-info.java file as per Qing Yu's PoC, instead finding intellij workaround. Should get to that in the future.
- Terminology and java environment setup in general was a real progress-killer. Stuck on JSP, module naming conventions (intellij was quite finicky with this, everything magically worked only after I restarted the project from scratch), bean, domain etc.
	- Feel like doing a crash course in spring boot first would expedite the process but the quick 3 hour tutorials I followed were not sufficient.
	- domain-driven design might have been a useful keyword to know ahead of time
- Medium article paywall cannot be bypassed with the bookmarklet anymore
- Spring data somehow allows us to specify business keys that are not autogenerated UID unlike Neo4j desktop. Need to figure out how this works.

# Misc. Notes
first tutorial is the second but with less detail, insufficient to follow along. Second tutorial frontloads code but explains annotations in detail after, sufficient to follow linearly.

# Todo
finish up https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#preface
