# Changelog
- Completed SIP report for school for June, looked into details for final presentation and report
- Finished User Story 5 tested with curl
- started looking into swagger

# Misc. Notes
- As discussed with Chun Wei, there is a summit for neo4j on 19 July. Am considering attending to hear about knowledge graphs and neo4j features which I have not worked with such as auradb, as well as to discuss my project with participants to see if there are approaches I have missed. However, unsure as it clashes with work.
- Might be good if i can schedule a zoom call to demo my work to double check that everything is as expected before writing the report

# Todo
- Learn swagger
- Communicate with ryan about report and api
