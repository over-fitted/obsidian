# Changelog
- Communicated difficulties about user stories performance issues on Slack
    - current workaround is to implement my own limits and relationship filters. Should be trivial to remove
    - hopefully do not need to rework the solution to make use of cypherdsl or java permutations, which may help with small cases but not with reasonably large cases
- New blocking issue about the last non-WIP user story posted on slack
- Otherwise completed user stories 1-4 with endpoints tested for stories 2 and 4
