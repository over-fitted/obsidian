# Changelog
- Fixed neo4j dataset to be consistent with Ryan's specifications
    -  Fixed bugs in cypher node-insertion code
        - extra wrong assignment to awards property without apoc processing
    - Verified that there are comments leading to non-existent movies
        - e.g. id `id: 573a1390f29313caabcd413b`
- Fixed Imdb rating property
    - Float should be represented as Double in java entity. Error message will give uncoercible converting from FLOAT to java String even though the actual error does not concern strings
- Added ability to find movie by id of corresponding imdb object
    - query by property of a child node, given a one to one relationship
- Found some Imdb nodes whose ratings are empty strings. Since datatype is different from property datatype in POJO entity, this resulted in coersion error
    - Deleted all such nodes with the code below
```cypher
match (i:Imdb) where apoc.meta.type(i.votes) <> "INTEGER" DETACH DELETE i
```
```json
"imdb": {
    "rating": "",
    "votes": "",
    "id": 1877727
}
```
- Found whole numbered imdb rating are casted as Integer instead of Float, which cannot be casted to Java Double
    - Converted all imdb ratings to float using `apoc.convert.toFloat`
- Added functionality to query by imdb.rating >= argument
- Added functionality to find all movies that cast a specific actor by actor name

# Misc. Ideas
- I realise I spent a lot of time figuring out how to do things the "right" way using Spring Data's inbuilt repository methods, when in reality I could have stuck to custom queries to make life easier
## Dealing with paths containing nodes with different labels
- I think we can use projections to circumvent the nodes having different schemas. Projection only needs ID to uniquely identify the nodes in the path. 
- To do this we can set all nodes to have the same datatype for their keys
#### Idea 1: Interface projection
- We can use an interface-based projection since that does not care about node labels. 
- Projection should only have getter for nodeid and child which is of type Projection
- This query part is uncertain since the java spring query method would need to know which domain the nodes are from before the query happens for mapping
    - could maybe find a way to obtain the label(s) of the node using an apoc meta method since the label(s) would be type String, and use that to determine which repository to use for the query
- Properties would be node key, and child node. Form a DAG kind of thing
#### Idea 2: Class-based projection
- We can create a new `Generic` label and apply that label to all nodes
- We can then create a `Generic` POJO domain class with only ID, child which is of type `Generic`, and possibly other additional properties to make life easier to abuse the schemaless nature of Cypher.
    - properties could include label type so we don't need a meta label method

# Todo
Biggest priorities on monday are handling multi-label paths for deliverable 1 of user stories v2, and discussing the new requirements provided by Qing Ru.

Preferably want to get a meeting about the requirements after Ryan and I have compiled our doubts, since at first glance there seems to be some ambiguity involved in the user stories.

Also look into dynamic labels as a possible node label-agnostic solution
