# Changelog
- looked into returning m, relationships, nodes in cypher query as per https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#custom-queries.for-relationships.long-paths.database
    - adapted movies shortest path, does not work
    - Equivalent cypher query seems to work in neo4j desktop for visualisation
```cypher
match p=shortestPath((m:Movie{title:"Titanic"})-[:Casts*]-(a:Movie{title:"Avatar"}))
WITH collect(p) as paths, m

WITH m,

reduce(a=[], node in reduce(b=[], c in [aa in paths | nodes(aa)] | b + c) | case when node in a then a else a + node end) as nodes,

reduce(d=[], relationship in reduce(e=[], f in [dd in paths | relationships(dd)] | e + f) | case when relationship in d then d else d + relationship end) as relationships

RETURN m, relationships, nodes;
```
- Attempted to use a similar technique with user comments, also does not work, only returns the source movie
- Attempted other method using queries for user comments, and for movie casts. Both only return the source node without relationships hydrated
    - https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#custom-queries.for-relationships.long-paths.client in general is really vague, e.g. what `[[rel1, rel2], [rel3, rel4]]` means
```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie{title: 'The Matrix'})<-[r:Commented_On]-(p:User) return m,collect(r),collect(p)
```
- Query used in docs also seems broken using \*..0 for path length

# Misc. ideas
Representing all paths seems tough, cannot find an example where many paths can be return while still taking a reasonable time to run. Would be more reasonable to specify path length as per queries below.

Also want to try using expandConfig
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54363918/apoc-path-expandconfig-extract-subject-object-predicate-triplet as per Qing Ru's option 4
- This lets us use arguments to adjust number of paths return + length of path, solving yesterday's issue
    - not necessarily required by user story that just wants us to find all paths
- Able to include more robust label filter
    - Blacklist filter `-`, termination filter `/`, end node filter `>`, whitelist filter `+`

# Todo

Current objective is to represent multiple paths. Sample queries selected below:
- Found query for demoing returning multiple paths
    - Read through data returned as records, seems that each path is separated by commas
    - 17 paths present
```cypher
match p=(m:Movie{title:"Batman"})-[:Casts*..7]-(n:Movie{title:"Avatar"})

return p
```
- Found query for multiple paths with different sources 1 sink, some path nodes shared by paths
    - 42 paths
```
match p=(m:Movie{title:"Avatar"})-[*..3]-(n:Movie{title:"Titanic"})

return p
```

Documentation seems not helpful with this. Since path is of variable length and same node can be used in multiple paths, use of projections may not be appropriate.

Key issue I want to solve is easily identifying each individual path, rather than just aggregating all nodes and relationships. Latter can already be achieved by returning path usually binded to variable p, contrary to documentation.

I wish to try 3 methods:
1. return each path as a string containing id of nodes involved, each separated by commas. Can use reduce or `apoc.text.join` to create the string
    1. Can then split to get node IDs, then create a PathNode query to recreate path using node IDs
        1. use either PathNodeRepository for every pair of nodes, or use CypherDSL to construct the full path. Want to try using the latter for PoC
    2. retrieving IDs on the path as per 1.1 feels hard to implement because of a lack of actual use-case. Might be better to work on front-end visualisation before pursuing this, so there is an actual use-case to meet
    3. Can use `apoc.text.format` if path length is fixed
2. use the neo4j client
3. (if needed) use the driver itself
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#neo4j-client

Should also re-read Qing Ru's repo this time with a focus on how results are represented.
