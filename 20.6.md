# Changelog
- Met up with Ryan to discuss new User Stories
- Looked into inheritance as a solution for cross-domain queries
- Updated all nodes to use PathNode label
- Updated all nodes to have a string id key
    - bulk updating all path nodes took 20+min still not done, switched to updating label by label
    - bulk updating casts also not working after 30 min
    - gave up and used neo4j to update ids, worked instantly
```cypher
MATCH (n) where n.id is null

SET n.id = apoc.create.uuid()

return n
```
- Cross domain query now works, showing all nodes involved in the path regardless of domain, and hydrating edges used in the root nodes, in order that they appear in the path
    - Due to inheritance, although we return a list of `PathNodes` which only contain a subset of the properties of the original domain entity, the returned nodes are also the actual domain entity which contains all the properties
    - tested only for nodes in the path, without relationship properties involved. Should test that soon
