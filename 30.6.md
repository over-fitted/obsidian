# changelog
- Added reduce in cypherdsl
- upgraded path return to also return edges in the path
    - can use a single query to return both edges and nodes, then process on our end to separate into edges and nodes. This reduces query overhead
    - can also consider having all edges appended to end of nodeid list, taking the complexity from O(n) to O(logn), but this way allows the idlist to be usable by itself visually
    - Will implement relationships appended after all node IDs for cypherDSL method
- created edgeDTO
    - Can map the strings in the path to either edgeDTO or nodes, then return a list of objects, or a pair of lists of objects
