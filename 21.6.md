# Changelog
- read through Qing Ru's comments on the v2 stories
- Looked further into using @DynamicLabels to find labels used by entity
    - @DynamicLabels can only capture labels not captured by the classes
    - I added a titanic label to only titanic movie nodes in neo4j. When retrieving them as pathnodes, pathnode and movie labels are not present in labels property since the domain class already represents the labels. However, since titanic label is not represented, it is inserted into the labels collection property
    - for some reason, after I added the titanic label, both titanic and movie appear as dynamiclabels when mapped to pathNodes, though the movies label is missing when movie class is returned

- Instead we could use instanceof to check what type the node object is, and proceed from there
- Tested @CompositeProperty using json request
    - Used Map<String, Object> as property
    - Tried using a nested map as property, got the following error: `org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type [java.util.LinkedHashMap<?, ?>] to type [org.neo4j.driver.Value]`
    - Tried using a list of values, neo4j only saves the first value
    - Using map of string keys and integers and strings as values works
        - automatically flatten into compositeProp.Key
        - need to access as node.\`compsiteProp.key\`
    - Seems like a good solution for automatically handling nested data of unknown structure, but cannot set schema for this nested data, and this nested data itself cannot be nested. May be a good idea to store IMDB like this, and tomatoes as the separate node, itself using one map each for viewer and critic ratings
    - Verified that can query on these maps in cypher, have not tried in spring data
- Tested using @CompositeProperty in java
    - tried to initialise a new cast, save it into castrepo, and set that as a compositeproperty value
        - cannot have domain entities as values 
        - values need to be convertable to type org.neo4j.driver.Value
        - Could possibly define such a convertable to serialise the class into a neo4j value and back
    - tried to insert a hashmap but same issue, cannot convert to type "Value"
- Skimmed error handling in spring
    - helpful null pointer exceptions are in java 14, we are using java 11
- Started looking into returning multiple paths
    - query in cypher enumerating all paths up to length 4 is massive and takes a long time
    - `MATCH p=(n{id:"573a1391f29313caabcd89aa"})-[*0..3]-(m{id:"573a139af29313caabcf0d74"}) return p`

    - Current method seems to work well with paths of length 2
        - can store multiple genres in genrelist of each node, thereby representing multiple paths
        - each user can store multiple comments relationships
        - still need to reconstruct paths based on data, need to look into some way of representing each path as a class of its own
            - considering just returning the ids of the nodes on each path, and somehow returning each path as a list of these ids
                - we can then reverse engineer the edges trivially
# Misc. Ideas
- For mixed-node filter stories, we could use name as the shared property for the filter as suggested in the story comments, but I already have Id as a string for all properties so that should suffice as a property shared by multiple domains
- Cannot use parameters in query path length
    - need to hardcode at compile time, or look into using cypher dsl

# Blockers (solved)
- lombok does not seem to work well with inheritance - allargsconstructor only takes in arguments for the current class but not parent class. Made my own constructor to circumvent the issue

# TODO
- spring data for neo4j return multiple paths
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54102069/neo4j-cypher-get-nodes-on-multiple-paths-separately-and-in-order
    - look into using the driver directly to access record by record
