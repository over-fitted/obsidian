# Changelog
- Did mid-term presentation
- Attempt to return data only for edges
	- Tried creating CommentRepository, cannot map back to comment objects as first-class objects
[[17.6]]	- Tried creating CommentDTO as class-based projection, also cannot map
	- Tried multi-level interface-based projection, also cannot map
```java
public interface UserCommentMovieDTO {  
    String getName();  
    List<CommentMovieDTO> getCommentMovieDTO();  
    interface CommentMovieDTO {  
        String getText();  
        MovieDTO getMovieDTO();  
        interface MovieDTO {  
            String getTitle();  
        }  
    }  
}
```

- Successfully added comment query functionality based on user name and movie title
	- use user node as intermediary to work with repository, pushed to repo
- Attempted to do shortest path movies
		- tried having casts relationship have 2 root nodes, both source and sink. This resulted in infinite recursion as java tries to hydrate sink node's relationships which include a reference back to the source which is itself rehydrated
# Misc. notes
- I think we generally cannot use CommentRepository, repo has to be based around nodes instead of relationships else root node mapping has issues
- collect seems to be used to avoid cartesian product in path, where root node is only listed once instead of duplicated for every relationship. This resolves the issue yesterday of needing to recreate path from document store, but does not seem to provide that much benefit - Effect on java spring data mapping is unknown still
