- Learned basics of postgres and inclusion of json request body
- Looked into repository save + how to update, made postrequest endpoint to generate new users based on json, using jackson to convert to equivalent POJO to save in repo
	- Duplicate post requests with same pojo in json body do not result in duplicate nodes created
	- Save method uses property annotated with `@Id` in domain class to identify nodes, and update/ignore pre-existing nodes
	- If try to update a node without `@Id` field but have `@GeneratedValue`, the repository will autogenerate a new node that has the @Id field, in additional to the old node![[Pasted image 20220616171049.png]]
	- If there is no `@GeneratedValue`, error thrown
- Investigated whether Neo4j internally generated id can be accessed by java spring boot
	- cannot, also tried `@Property("<id>")` to no avail, results in null being put 
- Looked into id generators
	- `@GeneratedValue` uses Java's autogenerator, can only return Long or long
	- use `@GeneratedValue(UUIDStringGenerator.class)` for string
	- id generators only run when an id is not already supplied by us - can reuse the mongodb ids
- Looked into Id in general
	- Java `@Id` is for internal use, no choice but to store on neo4j 
	- Node cannot be saved with `@Id` field set to null
	- If neo4j contains nodes that do not have the domain class' id, java will still be able to return those nodes with the id field set to null![[Pasted image 20220616165023.png]]
- Verified that some comments belong to non-existent emails
    - Jeffrey_Richardson not present
    - Had a typo in my cupher query that resulted in foobar being printed for some reason
- Attempted re-inserting nodes into neo4j via cypher, noted code used
    - serialisation had issues with movies, need to reattempt
    - `Property values can only be of primitive types or arrays thereof. Encountered: Map{wins -> Long(1), text -> String("1 win."), nominations -> Long(0)}.`

# Misc. Notes
- Obsidian converts spaces to nbsp; due to html whitespace collapsing. This resulted in my codeblocks code breaking in cypher, may be relevant when reviewing atlassian code
    - wasted quite a lot of time on this
# Blocking
- Confused about how to run one-off code without setting up an endpoint first, so that I can populate the database using Java
	- Ended up just using Neo4j to do it
