    - was using outdated library and outdated tutorials
    - most other documentation was also unhelpful
    - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Annotations
- Removed endpoints that do not display new relevant functionality

# Issues
- Map fixed keys and type of keys and values cannot be noted in content annotation of swagger. Must edit JSON/yaml directly, or substitiute map with classes
