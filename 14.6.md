# Changelog
- Took a look at using Jackson to populate DB with JSON
	- not great 
		- need to add `_class` field with class of the domain entity + clean oid from the data
		- cannot reference other domain entities by id
			- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58412091/can-jackson-resolve-ids-to-objects-using-spring-data-repositories ![[Pasted image 20220614140659.png]]
- took a look at example-based query
	- does not add unique functionality
- Added rough plan of all queries I intend to implement in Neo4j
- Added cross-domain query to find 6 degrees of separation, including edge information in path
	- used `curl localhost:8080/cast/shortest/Kevin_Bacon/Al_Pacino`
	- return data is like a document store, path has to be re-created from the document
	- so far can only return one type of node, and using edges that do not contain any data within them
	- obtained result:
```json

# Difficulties encountered (resolved)
- Accidentally added @RelationshipProperties to Cast domain class, error message did not help at all, googling did not help
	- eventually just spotted the mistake myself
# Added Todos
- Find shortest casts path between 2 movies, given that casts relationship root is now cast instead of movie
	- obtain edges
- Find path that utilises different labelled nodes
- Find path with content in edges
