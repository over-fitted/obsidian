# Changelog
- Experimented with expandPathConfig, and reduce
    - label filter is very robust, earlier comments about representing path sequences with virtual edges can be superceded by this
    - can use comma separated labels desired in path variable
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9623258/passing-an-array-or-list-to-pathvariable-spring-java
    - can include path length range + limit on # paths returned
    - can specify multiple terminator nodes
    - can specify to terminate path upon encountering a specified label
- Added find all casts paths 
    - paths represented as string as mentioned in yesterday's report, but using reduce
- Added find all paths between 2 arbitrary nodes

# Misc. Notes
- Found that variables cannot be used in node specifier
    - e.g. `MATCH (m{id:'$first'})`
    - Instead use WHERE statements

# Todo
- add filter to expandConfig method involving node properties
- do 3 node query
- do nested query as per user story
