# Changelog
- called Chun Wei and Ryan to show my API for sanity check, shortlisted questions for meeting
    - when a link is not specified as direct or indirect, what does it mean?
    - for the 3rd story onwards, should we be finding all paths between each pair of valid cast members, or should we ensure all movies in each traversal is valid? Result of the latter should be a subset of the results of the former
- Looked into NextJS and ViteJS
    - might be good to start learning ViteJS to serve front-end, which then polls the Java backend as a separate service
- looked into trpc vs gql
- looked into reactflow
    - Think will learn React and ViteJS for this

# To-do
- work on swagger
- get all APIs to work with casts if need be
- start on documentation
