## Position
- Consider in relational space
- more links = more central
	- degree centrality
- higher in-degree = popular
- higher out-degree = authoritative
	- covered by kleinberg
## Degree Distributions
- Scale-free
- follows power law![[Pasted image 20220601172913.png]]
- leads to small worlds clustering
- simulate with preferential attraction
	- rich get richer, more links = higher chance of new links

***
## Betweeness centrality
node is present in several shortest paths 

## Meso
- Delete edges of highest betweeness, see how many to cut to get separate communities
- use instead of max flow min cut since number of communities unknown
